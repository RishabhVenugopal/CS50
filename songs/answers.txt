Spotify might take the averages of danceability, valence, energy, to calculate the listeners Aura. This may not be representative of the listener however since
the user may listen to certain songs much more frequently than the rest so maybe taking a weighted average so that the more frequent songs have more weightage may better represent the users listening habits.
